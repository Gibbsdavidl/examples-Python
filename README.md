This repository contains analysis examples based on the ISB-CGC hosted TCGA data in BigQuery, using Python, IPython Notebooks, and Google Cloud Datalab.

### Where to start?
You can find an overview of the BigQuery tables in this [notebook](https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/The%20ISB-CGC%20open-access%20TCGA%20tables%20in%20BigQuery.ipynb) and from there, we suggest that you look at the two "Creating TCGA cohorts" notebooks ([part 1](https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Creating%20TCGA%20cohorts%20--%20part%201.ipynb) and [part 2](https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/blob/master/notebooks/Creating%20TCGA%20cohorts%20--%20part%202.ipynb)) which describe and make use of the Clinical and Biospecimen tables.  From there you can delve into the various molecular data tables as well as the Annotations table.  For now these sample notebooks are intentionally relatively simple and do not do any analysis that integrates data from multiple tables but once you have a grasp of how to use the data, developing your own more complex analyses should not be difficult.  You could even contribute an example back to our github repository!  You are also welcome to submit bug reports, comments, and feature-requests as [github issues](https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Python/issues).
